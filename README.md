# Hi, I'm Srivarshan! 👋


## 🚀 About Me

👋 Hello, my name is Srivarshan, and I am a 20-year-old third-year bachelor's degree student. 💻👨‍🎓

I consider myself a low-level programmer, and I am skilled in using several programming languages such as C++, Rust, and Python for most of my development work. 🧑‍💻👨‍💻

For web development, I use HTML, CSS, and React with TypeScript, along with the CSS library TailwindCSS. 💻🕸️🎨

I also develop APIs using Actixweb in Rust, and use SurrealDB as my database. 🚀🔗🗃️

I have a strong affinity for Linux, having used it as my daily driver OS for almost 3.5 years, and am an ArchLinux user. 🐧💻

I use C++ for computer vision and competitive programming, as well as for Web Assembly with Emscripten. To develop in C++, I use CMake for compiling my libraries and programs, and have learned about build systems to understand CMake.Recent I used SIMD intrinsics function with AVX2 & AVX512 . 👨‍💻👀

In addition, I use Python for computer vision and deep learning with libraries such as Numpy, OpenCV, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. To use Python for development, I also learned how to use Pyenv and Virtualenv to manage my Python environments and different Python versions. 🐍👁️‍🗨️🤖

Recently, I have started learning Rust, and I am falling in love with its memory safety and powerful macros. I use Rust to develop web APIs using Actixweb and SurrealDB as my database. 🦀👨‍💻🔥

While I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS as a CSS library for web development, my skills in C++, Python, and Rust are my primary focus. 🕸️👨‍💻

I prefer using Neovim as my code editor (sorry emacs), and my productive setup includes i3 with Tmux. 🖥️⌨️👨‍💻
